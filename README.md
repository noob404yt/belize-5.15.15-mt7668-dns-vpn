# PS4 Belize 5.15.15 Kernel with MT7668 WiFi/BT Fix (with DNS issue fix) & VPN support
The modified kernel based on [codedwrench's source ](https://ps4linux.com/downloads/#Kernel_515) includes:-
1. Fix and support for MT7668 WiFi/Bluetooth chipset with fix for DNS issues on PS4s with MT7668 chipset, as explained [here](https://ps4linux.com/dns-issues-mt7668-ps4-linux-fix/)
2. VPN support (Wireguard, OpenVPN), as explained [here](https://ps4linux.com/ps4-linux-vpn-wireguard-openvpn/)

This project is actually a continuation of the [MT7668 kernel modules for PS4](https://github.com/noob404yt/mt7668-wifi-bt).

## How to compile PS4 Belize kernel with MT7668 WiFi & Bluetooth support
Since the source has everything pre-packed, you can directly compile the kernel and use it to boot your PS4 Linux distro. Check the article on [compiling PS4 Linux kernel from source](https://ps4linux.com/compile-ps4-linux-kernel-tutorial/). You can also [add additional drivers](https://ps4linux.com/add-drivers-ps4-linux-kernel/).
